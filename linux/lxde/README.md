## Additional requirements

_sshpass_   
   
When the password is explicitly provided in the URI, `sshpass` is executed with the provided password and the ssh command.

## Action
Executes `lxterminal` with a command running `ssh`, passing the URI's parameters; handing back a regular shell afterwards.
